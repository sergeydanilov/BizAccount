Test Task For the client

Screening test:

â€œDesign and implement an Account that will represent a user's
account in a banking system."

The account will have the following information:

a. Balance - The amount of money the account holds
b. Currency - The currency of the account
c. User - the user it belongs to

On top of that we should be able:
a. To deposit money to the Account
b. To withdraw money from the Account

There is no need to store the information in the DB or to expose
it via the API.
It is only required to implement the Business layer.
Please implement only the bare minimum to support the above requirements.
Feel free to add unit tests if that is what you would do in your day-to-day job.
